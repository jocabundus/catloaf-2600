Keys and Doors:
------------------------------------------------------------

In this game, there are keys and doors. A key will break
after you open the correct door with it. So for example, it
takes 3 gold keys to open 3 gold-trim doors. View your
inventory to see how many keys you currently hold.


------------------------------------------------------------
Puzzles:
------------------------------------------------------------

The way through the labyrinth is blocked by a series of
puzzles. You must solve them to clear the way to the end.
You might be intimidated at first, but try anything you can
think of. This is the nature of the game.


------------------------------------------------------------
Secret Items:
------------------------------------------------------------

There's more to this game than just making it to the end.
There are some special items hidden within the labyrinth for
you to find. Once you make it to the end the first time,
play again to find those items.
